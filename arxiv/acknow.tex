\section{Acknowledgments}
This paper is a subset of the author's PhD thesis \cite{ref:evans_thesis}
which was completed under the supervision of Wei Zhang.
(The thesis \cite{ref:evans_thesis} contains some additional calculations
related to the $n=3$ case of \Cref{conj:inhomog_spherical}
which were not included in this paper, but can be found in the published thesis.
Some Sage source files are also provided in the published thesis.)
I thank my advisor Wei Zhang for suggesting this project,
for his infinite patience and kindness throughout my entire time during graduate school,
and his seemingly instantaneous response times at all hours of the day
to the many, many stupid questions I asked.

I thank Ryan C.~Chen for his interest in this project,
reading a draft of the thesis, and for suggesting \cite{ref:CLZ}
which helped to remove the hypotheses from the main result of this paper.
I also thank Mark Sellke for proofreading a draft of my PhD thesis
and finding several corrections.

I thank the organizers and attendees of the fall 2024
learning seminar on arithmetic inner product formula
for inviting me to speak about my work-in-progress, and their helpful comments on it
leading directly to improvements to this paper.
